My diverse academic background and research skills make me exceptionally sensitive to interdisciplinary research.\n\n\nQuestion-2\nWhat is your goal?\nSince entering the field of research, countless mentors and advisors have inspired me to move forward on the academic path. My short-term goal is to obtain a PhD degree within 5 years and publish my own perspectives in top-tier journals. As for long-term goals, academia is not my only choice; I also have my own experience and understanding in entrepreneurship and industry practice. In fact, beyond academia, engaging with, understanding, and grasping industry information is a great pleasure for me. I am willing to be part of the entrepreneurial world or work as an industry analyst. Overall, these things are interconnected.\n\n\nOther Questions\n\nWho are you? What makes you special?\nWhat do you stand for? For example, maybe you are passionate about open science and you prioritize publishing in open-access journals or publishing open source software.\nWho is your audience? This is important in terms of helping you understand your professional community as a scientist. What does the community value or not value? Does this align with your interests?\nWhat is your goal? This is a very personal question and there are no wrong answers. However, it is helpful to understand what your short-term and long-terms goals are. Some questions you might think about as you try to answer these two questions are:\nWhat motivates you?\nWhat projects have others complimented you on?\nWhich projects can I spend hours on and not feel overwhelmed or drained?\nFill in the following: “I want to be a leader in … &lt;&gt;” “In 5-10 years, I want to … &lt;&lt; insert thing you want to have accomplished &gt;&gt;”"

At the same time, the distribution characteristics of wage difference and individual wage also change significantly after group calculation, which provides ideas for subsequent variable adjustment and subgroup analysis.\nANOVA results show that only the square of Age can increase the explanatory power of Wage in the model, and there is no higher-order relationship between them.\nLocal regression describes the nonlinear joint with a higher degree of freedom model, and the results are in good agreement with the multi-variable model.\n\n\n\nFunctions used from packages\n\ndplyr/tidyr: filter(); select(); summarise(); group_by(); mutate() \nggplot2: geom_point(); geom_smooth(); geom_line(); geom_ribbon(); geom_bar\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nCleveland, William S., and Clive Loader. 1996. “Smoothing by Local Regression: Principles and Methods.” In Statistical Theory and Computational Aspects of Smoothing, edited by Wolfgang Härdle and Michael G.
